# Bengaluru-House-price-Prediction


In this project, I have gone through a step-by-step process of creating a website that can predict real estate prices. Firstly, I have used the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com to build a model using Sklearn and linear regression. Secondly, I wrote a Python Flask server that can use the saved model to handle HTTP requests. Finally,  created a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which will allow users to input parameters such as home square footage and number of bedrooms, and the website will then call the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
